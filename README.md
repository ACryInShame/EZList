# EZList
This is a iteration of lists that try to make the use of lists easier to understand by removing a lot of friction in their use. 

Examples of List Friction.
The use of Pop in order to get information from a list.
The use of an interator to go through the list.
the need to use loops just to change around aspects of a list
That returning the length of the list is different then returning the last point on a list.
The inability to use the [] operator

At This time, EZList is still in the works and not all functions are added.
